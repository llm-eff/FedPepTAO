348	an enjoyably half-wit remake of the venerable italian comedy big deal on madonna street .
349	ritchie 's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people 's faces to the fact amber is such a joke .

398	sunshine state lacks the kind of dynamic that limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece .
399	a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards .
400	it 's hard not to be seduced by ( witherspoon 's ) charisma , even in this run-of-the-mill vehicle , because this girl knows how to drive it to the max .
401	nair does capture the complexity of a big family and its trials and tribulations ...
402	the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes .
403	an engaging overview of johnson 's eccentric career .
404	will only satisfy those who ca n't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly .
405	on the right track to something that 's creepy and effective ... it 's just going to take more than a man in a bullwinkle costume to get there .
406	a richly imagined and admirably mature work from a gifted director who definitely has something on his mind .
407	the smartest bonehead comedy of the summer .
408	the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover .
409	writhing under dialogue like ` you 're from two different worlds ' and ` tonight the maid is a lie and this , this is who you are , ' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability .

411	borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu .

414	godawful boring slug of a movie .
415	mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
416	digital-video documentary about stand-up comedians is a great glimpse into a very different world .
417	grant gets to display his cadness to perfection , but also to show acting range that may surprise some who thought light-hearted comedy was his forte .
418	the level of maturity displayed by this 33-year-old first-time feature director is astonishing , considering her inexperience and her subject matter .
419	thoughtful , even stinging at times , and lots of fun .
420	alas , it 's neither .
421	this is n't a narrative film -- i do n't know if it 's possible to make a narrative film about september 11th , though i 'm sure some will try -- but it 's as close as anyone has dared to come .
422	greene delivers a typically solid performance in a role that is a bit of a departure from the noble characters he has played in the past , and he is matched by schweig , who carries the film on his broad , handsome shoulders .
423	the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion .
424	disturbingly superficial in its approach to the material .
425	we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .
426	a refreshingly honest and ultimately touching tale of the sort of people usually ignored in contemporary american film .
427	george clooney proves he 's quite a talented director and sam rockwell shows us he 's a world-class actor with confessions of a dangerous mind .
428	solid , lump-in-the-throat family entertainment that derives its power by sticking to the facts .
429	do n't plan on the perfect ending , but sweet home alabama hits the mark with critics who escaped from a small town life .
430	with generic sets and b-grade special effects , jason is about as convincing on the sci-fi front as tv 's defunct cleopatra 2525 .
431	i enjoyed the ride ( bumps and all ) , creamy depth , and ultimate theme .
432	somewhere short of tremors on the modern b-scene : neither as funny nor as clever , though an agreeably unpretentious way to spend ninety minutes .
433	undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters .
434	though the film 's scenario is certainly not earthshaking , this depiction of fluctuating female sexuality has two winning lead performances and charm to spare .
435	pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick .
436	so clichéd that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart .
437	like a south-of-the-border melrose place .
438	what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama .
439	oedekerk wrote patch adams , for which he should not be forgiven .
440	after making several adaptations of other writers ' work , armenian-canadian director atom egoyan broached an original treatment of a deeply personal subject .
441	it is intensely personal and yet -- unlike quills -- deftly shows us the temper of the times .
442	a pleasant enough comedy that should have found a summer place .
443	this is how you use special effects .
444	tadpole is a sophisticated , funny and good-natured treat , slight but a pleasure .
445	to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist .
446	you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production .
447	but even a hero can stumble sometimes .
448	writer-director burger imaginatively fans the embers of a dormant national grief and curiosity that has calcified into chronic cynicism and fear .
449	makes an aborbing if arguable case for the man 's greatness .
450	nicolas philibert observes life inside a one-room schoolhouse in northern france in his documentary to be and to have , easily one of the best films of the year .
451	ecks this one off your must-see list .
452	very solid , very watchable first feature for director peter sheridan
453	lame , haphazard teen comedy .
454	full of profound , real-life moments that anyone can relate to , it deserves a wide audience .
455	consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
456	ms. fulford-wierzbicki is almost spooky in her sulky , calculating lolita turn .
457	egoyan 's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you 'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious .
458	in the process , they demonstrate that there 's still a lot of life in hong kong cinema .
459	de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork .
460	too much of this well-acted but dangerously slow thriller feels like a preamble to a bigger , more complicated story , one that never materializes .
461	director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building .
462	now , if it only had a brain .

464	it 's the best film of the year so far , the benchmark against which all other best picture contenders should be measured .
465	the essential problem in orange county is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do .
466	some studio pizazz might have helped .
467	the film 's greatest asset is how much it 's not just another connect-the-dots , spy-on-the-run picture .
468	opens as promising as any war/adventure film you 'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled `` glory : a soldier 's story . ''
469	the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll .
470	on its own cinematic terms , it successfully showcases the passions of both the director and novelist byatt .
471	as conceived by mr. schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter 's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell .
472	wait for video -- and then do n't rent it .
473	but watching huppert , a great actress tearing into a landmark role , is riveting .
474	never ( sinks ) into exploitation .
475	the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them .

477	a startling and fresh examination of how the bike still remains an ambiguous icon in chinese society .
478	an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living .
479	a thoughtful look at a painful incident that made headlines in 1995 .
480	a real movie , about real people , that gives us a rare glimpse into a culture most of us do n't know .
481	when your leading ladies are a couple of screen-eating dominatrixes like goldie hawn and susan sarandon at their raunchy best , even hokum goes down easily .
482	the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .
483	a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy .
484	fine acting but there is no sense of connecting the dots , just dots .
485	rambles on in a disjointed , substandard fashion from one poorly executed action sequence to the next .
486	no , it 's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else .
487	if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he 'd have them mate .
488	( fessenden ) is much more into ambiguity and creating mood than he is for on screen thrills
489	dark , resonant , inventively detailed and packed with fleet turns of plot and a feast of visual amazement .
490	lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically .
491	a very funny movie .
492	suffocated at conception by its munchausen-by-proxy mum .
493	a vivid cinematic portrait .
494	but it offers plenty to ponder and chew on as its unusual relationship slowly unfolds .
495	a provocative movie about loss , anger , greed , jealousy , sickness and love .
496	by the end , i was looking for something hard with which to bludgeon myself unconscious .
497	majidi 's poetic love story is a ravishing consciousness-raiser , if a bit draggy at times .
498	this is the best american movie about troubled teens since 1998 's whatever .
499	if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why did n't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ?
500	others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore 's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding .
501	the creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts ' haunting is routine .
502	first good , then bothersome .
503	fails to bring as much to the table .
504	without heavy-handedness , dong provides perspective with his intelligent grasp of human foibles and contradictions .
505	a clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against ... well , just stuff .
506	even with all those rough edges safely sanded down , the american insomnia is still pretty darned good .
507	a charming , quirky and leisurely paced scottish comedy -- except with an outrageous central gimmick that could have been a reject from monty python 's meaning of life .
508	bow 's best moments are when he 's getting busy on the basketball court because that 's when he really scores .
509	the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized .
510	at nearly three hours , the whole of safe conduct is less than the sum of its parts .
511	just another fish-out-of-water story that barely stays afloat .
512	an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions .
513	without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie .
514	like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it .
515	zhang yimou delivers warm , genuine characters who lie not through dishonesty , but because they genuinely believe it 's the only way to bring happiness to their loved ones .
516	well-written , nicely acted and beautifully shot and scored , the film works on several levels , openly questioning social mores while ensnaring the audience with its emotional pull .
517	for the first two-thirds of this sparklingly inventive and artful , always fast and furious tale , kids will go happily along for the ride .
518	a classy item by a legend who may have nothing left to prove but still has the chops and drive to show how its done .
519	if this holiday movie is supposed to be a gift , somebody unwrapped it early , took out all the good stuff , and left behind the crap ( literally ) .
520	feels less like it 's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers .
521	a well-made thriller with a certain level of intelligence and non-reactionary morality .
522	no movement , no yuks , not much of anything .
523	most of the action setups are incoherent .
524	somehow we 're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g.i. jane .
525	good ol' urban legend stuff .
526	the thriller side of this movie is falling flat , as the stalker does n't do much stalking , and no cop or lawyer grasps the concept of actually investigating the case .
527	an amazing and incendiary movie that dives straight into the rough waters of contradiction .
528	a great ending does n't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell does n't even have a great ending .
529	the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life .
530	a gimmick in search of a movie : how to get carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible , plot mechanics be damned .
531	i regret to report that these ops are just not extreme enough .
532	so stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly .
533	at about 95 minutes , treasure planet maintains a brisk pace as it races through the familiar story .
534	intriguing and beautiful film , but those of you who read the book are likely to be disappointed .
535	the film is often filled with a sense of pure wonderment and excitement not often seen in today 's cinema du sarcasm
536	this is what imax was made for : strap on a pair of 3-d goggles , shut out the real world , and take a vicarious voyage to the last frontier -- space .
537	effectively feeds our senses with the chilling sights and sounds from within the camp to create a completely numbing experience .
538	these people would n't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance .
539	while mcfarlane 's animation lifts the film firmly above the level of other coming-of-age films ... it 's also so jarring that it 's hard to get back into the boys ' story .
540	a candid and often fascinating documentary about a pentecostal church in dallas that assembles an elaborate haunted house each year to scare teenagers into attending services .
541	warmed-over tarantino by way of wannabe elmore leonard .
542	the film is an enjoyable family film -- pretty much aimed at any youngster who loves horses .
543	the hours makes you examine your own life in much the same way its characters do , and the experience is profound .
544	but that 's just the problem with it - the director has n't added enough of his own ingredients .
545	home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do .
546	based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer 's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness .
547	automatically pegs itself for the straight-to-video sci-fi rental shelf .
548	sits uneasily as a horror picture ... but finds surprising depth in its look at the binds of a small family .
549	the issue of faith is not explored very deeply
550	the sequel has turned completely and irrevocably bizarre to the point of utter nonsense .
551	lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose .
552	moot point .
553	the film makes a strong case for the importance of the musicians in creating the motown sound .
554	the film runs on equal parts of innocence and wisdom -- wisdom that comes with experience .
555	the passions aroused by the discord between old and new cultures are set against the strange , stark beauty of the mideast desert , so lovingly and perceptively filmed that you can almost taste the desiccated air .
556	pryor lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs .
557	if you liked such movies as notting hill , four weddings and a funeral , bridget jones ' diary or high fidelity , then you wo n't want to miss about a boy .
558	even legends like alfred hitchcock and john huston occasionally directed trifles ... so it 's no surprise to see a world-class filmmaker like zhang yimou behind the camera for a yarn that 's ultimately rather inconsequential .
559	it will come as no surprise that the movie is n't scary .
560	often gruelling and heartbreaking to witness , but seldahl and wollter 's sterling performances raise this far above the level of the usual maudlin disease movie .
561	even by dumb action-movie standards , ballistic : ecks vs. sever is a dumb action movie .
562	one hour photo is an intriguing snapshot of one man and his delusions ; it 's just too bad it does n't have more flashes of insight .
563	john mctiernan 's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison 's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga .
564	if there 's a way to effectively teach kids about the dangers of drugs , i think it 's in projects like the ( unfortunately r-rated ) paid .
565	the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound .
566	proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism ... and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday 's weather report .
567	a tender and touching drama , based on the true story of a troubled african-american 's quest to come to terms with his origins , reveals the yearning we all have in our hearts for acceptance within the family circle .
568	the tug of war that ensues is as much a snapshot of modern china in microcosm as it is a crash course in movie mythology .
569	a comprehensive and provocative film -- one that pushes the boundaries of biography , and challenges its audience .
570	few films this year have been as resolute in their emotional nakedness .
571	this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .
572	you can feel the heat that ignites this gripping tale , and the humor and humanity that root it in feeling .
573	theirs is a simple and heart-warming story , full of mirth that should charm all but the most cynical .
574	if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford 's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it 's time to rethink independent films .
575	though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed ... that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr. schepisi 's seems skimpy and unclear .
576	like dickens with his passages , mcgrath crafts quite moving scenes throughout his resolutely dramatic variation on the novel .
577	not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it 's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies .
578	ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , ` what 's the point ? '
579	i weep for the future when a good portion of the respected critical community in this country consider blue crush to be an intelligent film about young women .
580	a soggy , shapeless mess ... just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie .
581	achieves a sort of filmic epiphany that revels in the true potential of the medium .
582	there 's no denying the physically spectacular qualities of the film ... or the emotional integrity of the performances .
583	it 's difficult to say whether the tuxedo is more boring or embarrassing -- i 'm prepared to call it a draw .
584	an endearingly offbeat romantic comedy with a great meet-cute gimmick .
585	a work of the utmost subtlety and perception , it marks the outstanding feature debut of writer-director eric byler , who understands the power of the implicit and the virtues of simplicity and economy .
586	too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 can not fly over , tunnel under or barrel through .
587	this overproduced and generally disappointing effort is n't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd .
588	the film 's sharp , often mischievous sense of humor will catch some off guard ...
589	a cockamamie tone poem pitched precipitously between swoony lyricism and violent catastrophe ... the most aggressively nerve-wracking and screamingly neurotic romantic comedy in cinema history .
590	not a movie but a live-action agitprop cartoon so shameless and coarse , it 's almost funny .
591	this delicately observed story , deeply felt and masterfully stylized , is a triumph for its maverick director .
592	oft-described as the antidote to american pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough
593	the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted .
594	winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults .
595	vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe ghost ship .
596	though mama takes a bit too long to find its rhythm and a third-act plot development is somewhat melodramatic , its ribald humor and touching nostalgia are sure to please anyone in search of a jules and jim for the new millennium .
597	a depressing confirmation of everything those of us who do n't object to the description `` unelected '' have suspected all along : george w. bush is an incurious , uncharismatic , overgrown frat boy with a mean streak a mile wide .
598	it is far from the worst , thanks to the topical issues it raises , the performances of stewart and hardy , and that essential feature -- a decent full-on space battle .
599	a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments .
600	propelled not by characters but by caricatures .
601	never again swings between false sentiment and unfunny madcap comedy and , along the way , expects the audience to invest in the central relationship as some kind of marriage of true minds .
602	a well acted and well intentioned snoozer .
603	goyer 's screenplay and direction are thankfully understated , and he has drawn excellent performances from his cast .
604	aside from being the funniest movie of the year , simone , andrew niccol 's brilliant anti-hollywood satire , has a wickedly eccentric enchantment to it .
605	eventually , it wins you over .
606	a boring , wincingly cute and nauseatingly politically correct cartoon guaranteed to drive anyone much over age 4 screaming from the theater .
607	( t ) hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the stepford wives mentality does n't work in a modern context .
608	there are moments it can be heart-rending in an honest and unaffected ( and gentle ) way .
609	bubba ho-tep is a wonderful film with a bravura lead performance by bruce campbell that does n't deserve to leave the building until everyone is aware of it .
610	what 's most striking about this largely celebratory film ... is the sense of isolation that permeates these bastions of individuality in an ikea world .
611	the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect .
612	but fans should have fun meeting a brand-new pokemon called celebi .
613	this is art paying homage to art .
614	a pleasurably jacked-up piece of action moviemaking .
615	like most bond outings in recent years , some of the stunts are so outlandish that they border on being cartoonlike .
616	god help the poor woman if attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional yvan 's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse .
617	wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert 's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn .
618	the film 's 45-minute running time stops shy of overkill , though viewers may be more exhausted than the athletes onscreen .
619	a loving little film of considerable appeal .
620	demme 's loose approach kills the suspense .
621	`` antwone fisher '' is an earnest , by-the-numbers effort by washington .
622	he simply presents his point of view that ayurveda works .
623	you 're better off staying home and watching the x-files .
624	with youthful high spirits , tautou remains captivating throughout michele 's religious and romantic quests , and she is backed by a likable cast .
625	but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film .
626	majidi gets uniformly engaging performances from his largely amateur cast .
627	stephen earnhart 's homespun documentary mule skinner blues has nothing but love for its posse of trailer park denizens .
628	haneke challenges us to confront the reality of sexual aberration .
629	an offbeat , sometimes gross and surprisingly appealing animated film about the true meaning of the holidays .
630	the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset .
631	( it 's ) difficult to get beyond the overall blandness of american chai , despite its likable performances and refreshingly naive point of view .
632	once the audience figure out what 's being said , the filmmaker 's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care .
633	watstein handily directs and edits around his screenplay 's sappier elements ... and sustains off the hook 's buildup with remarkable assuredness for a first-timer .
634	this is n't my favorite in the series , still i enjoyed it enough to recommend .
635	the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel .
636	as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure .
637	has a shambling charm ... a cheerfully inconsequential diversion .
638	look , this is a terrific flick replete with dazzling camera-work , dancing and music .
639	... both hokey and super-cool , and definitely not in a hurry , so sit back , relax and have a few laughs while the little ones get a fuzzy treat . '
640	what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 .
641	this is one for the ages .
642	eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work .
643	from spiritual rebirth to bruising defeat , vincent 's odyssey resonates in a profound way , comparable to the classic films of jean renoir .
644	the central story lacks punch .
645	... fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense .
646	though of particular interest to students and enthusiast of international dance and world music , the film is designed to make viewers of all ages , cultural backgrounds and rhythmic ability want to get up and dance .
647	why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from shirley jackson , richard matheson ... and puke up something like rose red ?
648	parker holds true to wilde 's own vision of a pure comedy with absolutely no meaning , and no desire to be anything but a polished , sophisticated entertainment that is in love with its own cleverness .
649	jason x has cheesy effects and a hoary plot , but its macabre , self-deprecating sense of humor makes up for a lot .
650	flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as morvern 's thick , working-class scottish accent .
651	the backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense .
652	invincible is a wonderful movie .
653	this pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film 's producers would be in the clink for life .
654	japan 's premier stylist of sex and blood hits audiences with what may be his most demented film to date .
655	it is interesting and fun to see goodall and her chimpanzees on the bigger-than-life screen .
656	finally , a genre movie that delivers -- in a couple of genres , no less .
657	a broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags .
658	you 'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus .
659	if it tried to do anything more , it would fail and perhaps explode , but at this level of manic whimsy , it is just about right .
660	a sad , superior human comedy played out on the back roads of life .
661	a shambles of a movie -- visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly ... its hilarity is completely unintentional .
662	the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep .
663	for anyone who grew up on disney 's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor .
664	` enigma ' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable .
665	star wars is back in a major way .
666	bullock 's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
667	it 's endearing to hear madame d. refer to her husband as ` jackie ' -- and he does make for excellent company , not least as a self-conscious performer .
668	though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work .
669	this is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few .
670	the movie feels like it 's going to be great , and it carries on feeling that way for a long time , but takeoff just never happens .
671	a pro-fat farce that overcomes much of its excessive moral baggage thanks to two appealing lead performances .
672	an impressive if flawed effort that indicates real talent .
673	do n't waste your money .
674	it 's a bittersweet and lyrical mix of elements .
675	the movie 's quiet affirmation of neighborhood values gives it an honest , lived-in glow .
676	too stupid to be satire , too obviously hateful to be classified otherwise , frank novak 's irritating slice of lumpen life is as reliably soul-killing as its title is nearly meaningless .
677	marvelous , merry and , yes , melancholy film .
678	i tried to read the time on my watch .
679	but based on cq , i 'll certainly be keeping an eye out for his next project .
680	i spy is an embarrassment , a monotonous , disjointed jumble of borrowed plot points and situations .
681	occasionally , in the course of reviewing art-house obscurities and slam-bam action flicks , a jaded critic smacks into something truly new .
682	her delivery and timing are flawless .
683	but buying into sham truths and routine `` indie '' filmmaking , freundlich has made just another safe movie .
684	gee , a second assassin shot kennedy ?
685	a charming romantic comedy that is by far the lightest dogme film and among the most enjoyable .
686	every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point .
687	a whole lot foul , freaky and funny .
688	could the whole plan here have been to produce something that makes fatal attraction look like a classic by comparison ?
689	the cast is uniformly excellent and relaxed .
690	the film is just a big , gorgeous , mind-blowing , breath-taking mess .
691	reggio 's trippy , ambitious downer can also sometimes come across like nothing more than a glorified nike ad .
692	the more kevin costner rests on his pretty-boy laurels , the public is , regrettably , going to have tepid films like dragonfly tossed at them .
693	director benoit jacquot , making his first opera-to-film translation with tosca , conveys the heaving passion of puccini 's famous love-jealousy - murder-suicide fandango with great cinematic innovation .
694	it 's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really does n't fit the part .
695	the film often achieves a mesmerizing poetry .
696	i love the way that it took chances and really asks you to take these great leaps of faith and pays off .
697	imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you 've imagined the ring .
698	if we do n't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get .
699	a generation x artifact , capturing a brief era of insanity in the sports arena that surely can not last .
700	bad company leaves a bad taste , not only because of its bad-luck timing , but also the staleness of its script .
701	when a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that 's a bad sign .
702	as green-guts monster movies go , it 's a beaut .
703	still , i thought it could have been more .
704	it 's a nicely detailed world of pawns , bishops and kings , of wagers in dingy backrooms or pristine forests .
705	good actress .
706	evokes a little of the fear that parents have for the possible futures of their children -- and the sometimes bad choices mothers and fathers make in the interests of doing them good .
707	still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral .
708	renner 's performance as dahmer is unforgettable , deeply absorbing .
709	marisa tomei is good , but just a kiss is just a mess .
710	complex , affecting and uniquely almodóvar , the film evokes strong emotions and pushes viewers to question their deepest notions of moral right and wrong .
711	it 's almost impossible not to be moved by the movie 's depiction of sacrifice and its stirring epilogue in post-soviet russia .
712	a compendium of solondz 's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes .
713	presents an astute appraisal of middle american musical torpor and the desperate struggle to escape it .
714	about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through .
715	dreary , highly annoying ... ` some body ' will appeal to no one .
716	sharp , lively , funny and ultimately sobering film .
717	the premise is overshadowed by the uberviolence of the clericks as this becomes just another kung-fu sci-fi movie with silly action sequences .
718	one of those rare , exhilarating cinematic delights that gets even better in hindsight , as you mull over its every nuance in your mind .
719	i like frank the pug , though .
720	instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart 's war , like the st. louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started .
721	if it 's possible for a sequel to outshine the original , then sl2 does just that .
722	divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood may not be exactly divine , but it 's definitely -- defiantly -- ya ya , what with all of those terrific songs and spirited performances .
723	tsai ming-liang has taken his trademark style and refined it to a crystalline point .
724	those who would follow haneke on his creepy explorations ... are rewarded by brutal , committed performances from huppert and magimel .
725	what could have become just another cautionary fable is allowed to play out as a clever , charming tale -- as pleasantly in its own way as its self-dramatizing characters .
726	( schweiger is ) talented and terribly charismatic , qualities essential to both movie stars and social anarchists .
727	dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter .
728	for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer .
729	credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment .
730	a frantic search for laughs , with a hit-to-miss ratio that does n't exactly favor the audience .
731	in its ragged , cheap and unassuming way , the movie works .
732	this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on .
733	a compelling journey ... and `` his best friend remembers '' is up there with the finest of specials .
734	this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions .
735	meandering , sub-aquatic mess : it 's so bad it 's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie .
736	an often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach
737	watching haneke 's film is , aptly enough , a challenge and a punishment .
738	an ungainly , comedy-deficient , b-movie rush job ...
739	considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well .
740	there is a kind of attentive concern that hoffman brings to his characters , as if he has been giving them private lessons , and now it is time for their first public recital .
741	this cuddly sequel to the 1999 hit is a little more visually polished , a little funnier , and a little more madcap .
742	the story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business .
743	the tenderness of the piece is still intact .
744	a simmering psychological drama in which the bursts of sudden violence are all the more startling for the slow buildup that has preceded them .
745	it has fun being grown up .
746	( newton ) wanders through charlie completely unaware she needs to show some presence and star quality .
747	an exceedingly clever piece of cinema .
748	a psychological thriller with a smart script and an obsessive-compulsive 's attention to detail .
749	a great comedy filmmaker knows great comedy need n't always make us laugh .
750	i do n't think i 've been as entranced and appalled by an asian film since shinya tsukamoto 's iron man .
751	too close to phantom menace for comfort .
752	this film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience .
753	he 's super spy !
754	the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .
755	choose your reaction : a. ) that sure is funny !
756	not ` terrible filmmaking ' bad , but more like , ' i once had a nightmare like this , and it 's now coming true ' bad .
757	we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas .
758	a byzantine melodrama that stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido .
759	the film overcomes the regular minefield of coming-of-age cliches with potent doses of honesty and sensitivity .
760	its mysteries are transparently obvious , and it 's too slowly paced to be a thriller .
761	like its two predecessors , 1983 's koyaanisqatsi and 1988 's powaqqatsi , the cinematic collage naqoyqatsi could be the most navel-gazing film ever .
762	the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants ' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed .
763	a masterful film from a master filmmaker , unique in its deceptive grimness , compelling in its fatalist worldview .
764	a truly moving experience , and a perfect example of how art -- when done right -- can help heal , clarify , and comfort .
765	it 's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you 're more than six years old .
766	just a bloody mess .
767	schmaltzy and unfunny , adam sandler 's cartoon about hanukkah is numbingly bad , little nicky bad , 10 worst list bad .
768	offers a breath of the fresh air of true sophistication .
769	fans of behan 's work and of irish movies in general will be rewarded by borstal boy .
770	... a poignant and powerful narrative that reveals that reading writing and arithmetic are not the only subjects to learn in life .
771	i found it slow , drab , and bordering on melodramatic .
772	the film 's real appeal wo n't be to clooney fans or adventure buffs , but to moviegoers who enjoy thinking about compelling questions with no easy answers .
773	( wendigo is ) why we go to the cinema : to be fed through the eye , the heart , the mind .
774	it is risky , intelligent , romantic and rapturous from start to finish .
775	the whole cast looks to be having so much fun with the slapstick antics and silly street patois , tossing around obscure expressions like bellini and mullinski , that the compact 86 minutes breezes by .
776	she must have a very strong back .
777	compelling as it is exotic , fast runner has a plot that rivals shakespeare for intrigue , treachery and murder .
778	better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine .
779	this is a raw and disturbing tale that took five years to make , and the trio 's absorbing narrative is a heart-wrenching showcase indeed .
780	jirí hubac 's script is a gem .
781	this is n't a `` friday '' worth waiting for .
782	de niro looks bored , murphy recycles murphy , and you mentally add showtime to the pile of hollywood dreck that represents nothing more than the art of the deal .
783	the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable .
784	still pretentious and filled with subtext , but entertaining enough at ` face value ' to recommend to anyone looking for something different .
785	almost everything else is wan .
786	just because it really happened to you , honey , does n't mean that it 's interesting to anyone else .
787	there has been much puzzlement among critics about what the election symbolizes .
788	an enchanting film that presents an audacious tour of the past and takes within its warm embrace the bounties of cultural artifacts inside st. petersburg 's hermitage museum .
789	choppy editing and too many repetitive scenes spoil what could have been an important documentary about stand-up comedy .
790	it 's the kind of pigeonhole-resisting romp that hollywood too rarely provides .
791	much of the way , though , this is a refreshingly novel ride .
792	the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected .
793	nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichés and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera .
794	any one episode of the sopranos would send this ill-conceived folly to sleep with the fishes .
795	needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey .
796	de oliveira creates an emotionally rich , poetically plump and visually fulsome , but never showy , film whose bittersweet themes are reinforced and brilliantly personified by michel piccoli .
797	if this movie were a book , it would be a page-turner , you ca n't wait to see what happens next .
798	watching it is rather like viewing a long soap opera in which only the first episode was any good .
799	most of crush is a clever and captivating romantic comedy with a welcome pinch of tartness .
800	there 's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought .
801	what full frontal lacks in thematic coherence it largely makes up for as loosey-goosey , experimental entertainment .
802	so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program .
803	denis and co-writer michele petin 's impeccable screenplay penetrates with a rawness that that is both unflinching and tantalizing .
804	a deceivingly simple film , one that grows in power in retrospect .
805	as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters ' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them .
806	if no one singles out any of these performances as award-worthy , it 's only because we would expect nothing less from this bunch .
807	i hated every minute of it .
808	even if you ca n't pronounce `` gyro '' correctly , you 'll appreciate much of vardalos ' humor , which transcends ethnic boundaries .
809	... always remains movingly genuine .
810	creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller .
811	there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .
812	( broomfield ) uncovers a story powerful enough to leave the screen sizzling with intrigue .
813	at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider 's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about .
814	what happened with pluto nash ?
815	there is n't a weak or careless performance amongst them .
816	edited and shot with a syncopated style mimicking the work of his subjects , pray turns the idea of the documentary on its head , making it rousing , invigorating fun lacking any mtv puffery .
817	( howard ) so good as leon barlow ... that he hardly seems to be acting .
818	another great ` what you do n't see ' is much more terrifying than what you do see thriller , coupled with some arresting effects , incandescent tones and stupendous performances
819	a modest pleasure that accomplishes its goals with ease and confidence .
820	lanie 's professional success means she must be a failure at life , because she 's driven by ambition and does n't know how to have fun .
821	it 's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high .
822	this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through .
823	you might not want to hang out with samantha , but you 'll probably see a bit of yourself in her unfinished story .
824	hilarious , touching and wonderfully dyspeptic .
825	rather , you 'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief .
826	this examination of aquatic life off the shores of the baja california peninsula of mexico offers an engrossing way to demonstrate the virtues of the imax format .
827	the noble tradition of men in drag hits an all-time low in sorority boys , whose makers apparently believe that women 's clothing can cover up any deficiency in acting , writing or direction .
828	when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever .
829	the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film is n't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .
830	the stories here suffer from the chosen format .
831	a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller .
832	without a strong script and energetic acting , dogma films can produce the same sleep-inducing effects as watching your neighbor 's home videos .
833	its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent dumas botch-jobs , the man in the iron mask and the musketeer .
834	stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara does n't distinguish itself from the herd .
835	ridiculous .
836	the vampire thriller blade ii starts off as a wild hoot and then sucks the blood out of its fun -- toward the end , you can feel your veins cringing from the workout .
837	most impressive , though , is the film 's open-ended finale that refuses to entirely close its characters ' emotional wounds .
838	succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies .
839	this goofy gangster yarn never really elevates itself from being yet another earnestly generic crime-busting comic vehicle -- a well-intentioned remake that shows some spunk and promise but fails to register as anything distinctive or daring

841	eight crazy nights is a showcase for sandler 's many talents .
842	both deeply weird and charmingly dear .
843	tom green just gives them a bad odor .

845	the year 's happiest surprise , a movie that deals with a real subject in an always surprising way .
846	as if to prove a female director can make a movie with no soft edges , kathryn bigelow offers no sugar-coating or interludes of lightness .
847	if i spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it 's trying to reap from the moviegoing public .
848	nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and showtime is crammed full of them .
849	this is simply the most fun you 'll ever have with a documentary !
850	it 's rather like a lifetime special -- pleasant , sweet and forgettable .
851	i like the new footage and still love the old stuff .
852	collateral damage is , despite its alleged provocation post-9 / 11 , an antique , in the end .
853	it sounds sick and twisted , but the miracle of shainberg 's film is that it truly is romance

855	gosling provides an amazing performance that dwarfs everything else in the film .
856	a great idea becomes a not-great movie .
857	you 'll be left with the sensation of having just witnessed a great performance and , perhaps , give in to the urge to get on your feet and shake it .
858	farrell ... thankfully manages to outshine the role and successfully plays the foil to willis 's world-weary colonel .
859	the film would work much better as a video installation in a museum , where viewers would be free to leave .
860	the invincible werner herzog is alive and well and living in la
861	this time kaufman 's imagination has failed him .
862	... this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core .
863	arnold 's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces .
864	the film is all a little lit crit 101 , but it 's extremely well played and often very funny .
865	... a haunting vision , with images that seem more like disturbing hallucinations .
866	even when foreign directors ... borrow stuff from hollywood , they invariably shake up the formula and make it more interesting .
867	though the controversial korean filmmaker 's latest effort is not for all tastes , it offers gorgeous imagery , effective performances , and an increasingly unsettling sense of foreboding .
868	even die-hard fans of japanese animation ... will find this one a challenge .
869	the story loses its bite in a last-minute happy ending that 's even less plausible than the rest of the picture .
870	the reason this picture works better than its predecessors is that myers is no longer simply spoofing the mini-mod-madness of '60s spy movies .
871	this may not have the dramatic gut-wrenching impact of other holocaust films , but it 's a compelling story , mainly because of the way it 's told by the people who were there .
872	i would have preferred a transfer down the hall to mr. holland 's class for the music , or to robin williams 's lecture so i could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve .
873	fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters .
874	the result is something quite fresh and delightful .
875	birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it .
876	it might be tempting to regard mr. andrew and his collaborators as oddballs , but mr. earnhart 's quizzical , charming movie allows us to see them , finally , as artists .
877	although it 's a bit smug and repetitive , this documentary engages your brain in a way few current films do .
878	might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr. eyre 's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage .
879	focuses on joan 's raging hormones and sledgehammers the audience with spanish inquisitions about her `` madness '' so much that i became mad that i wasted 123 minutes and $ 9.50 on this 21st century torture device .
880	although trying to balance self-referential humor and a normal ol' slasher plot seemed like a decent endeavor , the result does n't fully satisfy either the die-hard jason fans or those who can take a good joke .
881	as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson 's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .
882	the story 's so preposterous that i did n't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved .
883	it 's absolutely spooky how lillard channels the shagster right down to the original casey kasem-furnished voice .
884	it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes .
885	an intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort .
886	the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly - stunning insight that crime does n't pay .
887	no reason for anyone to invest their hard-earned bucks into a movie which obviously did n't invest much into itself either .
888	all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click .
889	leave it to rohmer , now 82 , to find a way to bend current technique to the service of a vision of the past that is faithful to both architectural glories and commanding open spaces of the city as it was more than two centuries ago .
890	calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it 's more like entertainment for trolls .
891	it 's a movie -- and an album -- you wo n't want to miss .
892	fisher has bared his soul and confronted his own shortcomings here in a way ... that feels very human and very true to life .
893	never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful .
894	to the film 's credit , the acting is fresh and unselfconscious , and munch is a marvel of reality versus sappy sentiment .
895	a compelling portrait of moral emptiness
896	beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines ... there just is n't much to laugh at .
897	the unceasing sadism is so graphically excessive , the director just ends up exposing his own obsession .
898	a thinly veiled excuse for wilson to play his self-deprecating act against murphy 's well-honed prima donna shtick .
899	lee jeong-hyang tells it so lovingly and films it so beautifully that i could n't help being captivated by it .
900	a frustrating combination of strained humor and heavy-handed sentimentality .
901	do n't expect any surprises in this checklist of teamwork cliches ...
902	ranks among willams ' best screen work .
903	despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style .
904	it 's both a necessary political work and a fascinating documentary ...
905	well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special .
906	for caine lovers only .
907	maybe i found the proceedings a little bit too conventional .
908	as lo-fi as the special effects are , the folks who cobbled nemesis together indulge the force of humanity over hardware in a way that george lucas has long forgotten .
909	frenetic but not really funny .
910	as your relatives swap one mundane story after another , you begin to wonder if they are ever going to depart .
911	a psychologically rich and suspenseful moral thriller with a stellar performance by al pacino .
912	at its best early on as it plays the culture clashes between the brothers .
913	sturdy , entertaining period drama ... both caine and fraser have their moments .
914	rain is a small treasure , enveloping the viewer in a literal and spiritual torpor that is anything but cathartic .

916	an idealistic love story that brings out the latent 15-year-old romantic in everyone .
917	... in this incarnation its fizz is infectious .
918	a hysterical yet humorless disquisition on the thin line between sucking face and literally sucking face .
919	watching beanie and his gang put together his slasher video from spare parts and borrowed materials is as much fun as it must have been for them to make it .
920	smith 's point is simple and obvious -- people 's homes are extensions of themselves , and particularly eccentric people have particularly eccentric living spaces -- but his subjects are charmers .
921	a refreshingly authentic coming-of-age tale .
922	whether seen on a 10-inch television screen or at your local multiplex , the edge-of-your-seat , educational antics of steve irwin are priceless entertainment .
923	there are touching moments in etoiles , but for the most part this is a dull , dour documentary on what ought to be a joyful or at least fascinating subject .
924	too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise .
925	a wildly funny prison caper .
926	the story feels more like a serious read , filled with heavy doses of always enticing sayles dialogue .
927	a cop story that understands the medium amazingly well .
928	andy garcia enjoys one of his richest roles in years and mick jagger gives his best movie performance since , well , performance .
929	abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists .
930	bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description .
931	the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten ... make that three minutes .
932	this is a film brimming with detail and nuance and one that speaks volumes about the ability of the human spirit to find solace in events that could easily crush it forever .
933	the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film 's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them .
934	where last time jokes flowed out of cho 's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines .
935	it uses an old-time formula , it 's not terribly original and it 's rather messy -- but you just have to love the big , dumb , happy movie my big fat greek wedding .
936	as ( the characters ) get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound .
937	it 's laughing at us .
938	intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .
939	in his debut as a film director , denzel washington delivers a lean and engaging work .

942	i did n't believe for a moment in these villains or their plot .
943	what makes the movie a comedy is the way it avoids the more serious emotions involved .
944	... ambition is in short supply in the cinema , and egoyan tackles his themes and explores his characters ' crises with seriousness and compassion .
945	my response to the film is best described as lukewarm .
946	not for everyone , but for those with whom it will connect , it 's a nice departure from standard moviegoing fare .
947	denzel washington 's efforts are sunk by all the sanctimony .
948	i wish i could say `` thank god it 's friday '' , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over .

963	still , i 'm not quite sure what the point is ...
964	it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world .

966	for anyone who remembers the '60s or is interested in one man 's response to stroke , ram dass : fierce grace is worth seeking out .
967	neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn .
968	ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year 's best acting , personal velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum .
969	a dreary rip-off of goodfellas that serves as a muddled and offensive cautionary tale for hispanic americans .
970	a 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode tv series , with all of the pitfalls of such you 'd expect .
971	the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun .
972	it 's painful .
973	flavorful and romantic , you could call this how martha got her groove back -- assuming , that is , she ever had one to begin with .
974	for a good chunk of its running time , trapped is an effective and claustrophobic thriller .
975	it 's not horrible , just horribly mediocre .
976	the kooky yet shadowy vision clooney sustains throughout is daring , inventive and impressive .
977	this is a happy throwback to the time when cartoons were cinema 's most idiosyncratic form instead of one of its most predictable .
978	it suggests the wide-ranging effects of media manipulation , from the kind of reporting that is done by the supposedly liberal media ... to the intimate and ultimately tragic heartache of maverick individuals like hatfield and hicks .
979	but this time there 's some mold on the gold .
980	this ecologically minded , wildlife friendly film teaches good ethics while entertaining with its unconventionally wacky but loving family

982	the powers team has fashioned a comedy with more laughs than many , no question .
983	clever , brutal and strangely soulful movie .
984	if you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still would n't add up to the time required to boil a four - minute egg .
985	somewhat blurred , but kinnear 's performance is razor sharp .
986	what 's next ?
987	attal mixes comedy with a serious exploration of ego and jealousy within a seemingly serene marriage .

989	the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic .
990	... too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film .
991	this is the type of movie best enjoyed by frat boys and college kids while sucking on the bong and downing one alcoholic beverage after another .
992	it 's an old story , but a lively script , sharp acting and partially animated interludes make just a kiss seem minty fresh .
993	for the first time in several years , mr. allen has surpassed himself with the magic he 's spun with the hollywood empress of ms. leoni 's ellie .

997	it 's one of the saddest films i have ever seen that still manages to be uplifting but not overly sentimental .
998	the only thing that could possibly make them less interesting than they already are is for them to get full montied into a scrappy , jovial team .
999	... a big , baggy , sprawling carnival of a movie , stretching out before us with little rhyme or reason .
1000	there are as many misses as hits , but ultimately , it finds humor in the foibles of human behavior , and it 's a welcome return to the roots of a genre that should depend on surprises .
1001	a grim , flat and boring werewolf movie that refuses to develop an energy level .
1002	it could change america , not only because it is full of necessary discussion points , but because it is so accessible that it makes complex politics understandable to viewers looking for nothing but energetic entertainment .
1003	a sour , nasty offering .

1005	for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond 's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .
1006	the filmmakers skillfully evoke the sense of menace that nature holds for many urban dwellers .
1007	mr. parker has brilliantly updated his source and grasped its essence , composing a sorrowful and hilarious tone poem about alienated labor , or an absurdist workplace sitcom .
1008	an intelligent , moving and invigorating film .
1009	( but it 's ) worth recommending because of two marvelous performances by michael caine and brendan fraser .
1010	a turgid little history lesson , humourless and dull .
1011	a cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man .
1012	succeeds in providing a disquiet world the long-dreaded completion of the police academy series .

1014	adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse .
1015	a tale of horror and revenge that is nearly perfect in its relentless descent to the depths of one man 's tortured soul .
1016	looks awfully like one long tourist spot for a mississippi that may never have existed outside of a scriptwriter 's imagination .
1017	an unabashedly schmaltzy and thoroughly enjoyable true story .
1018	this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982 's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh .
1019	this is a terrific character study , a probe into the life of a complex man .
1020	... ( a ) strained comedy that jettisons all opportunities for rock to make his mark by serving up the usual chaotic nonsense .
1021	the picture , scored by a perversely cheerful marcus miller accordion/harmonica/banjo abomination , is a monument to bad in all its florid variety .
1022	( gai ) comes closer to any actress i can remember to personifying independence in its purest and , yes , most intimidating form .
1023	daring , mesmerizing and exceedingly hard to forget .
1024	a solidly seaworthy chiller .
1025	a somewhat crudely constructed but gripping , questing look at a person so racked with self-loathing , he becomes an enemy to his own race .
1026	rich in detail , gorgeously shot and beautifully acted , les destinees is , in its quiet , epic way , daring , inventive and refreshingly unusual .
1027	with a story as bizarre and mysterious as this , you do n't want to be worrying about whether the ineffectual broomfield is going to have the courage to knock on that door .
1028	reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world 's remarkably varying human population and mindset , and its capacity to heal using creative , natural and ancient antidotes .
1029	i hate this movie
1030	you might not buy the ideas .
1031	it 's not exactly a gourmet meal but the fare is fair , even coming from the drive-thru .
1032	but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .
1033	cantet perfectly captures the hotel lobbies , two-lane highways , and roadside cafes that permeate vincent 's days
1034	kwan makes the mix-and - match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action .
1035	... surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs .
1036	it 's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it does n't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor .
1037	the overall feel of the film is pretty cheesy , but there 's still a real sense that the star trek tradition has been honored as best it can , given the embarrassing script and weak direction .
1038	despite a story predictable enough to make the sound of music play like a nail-biting thriller , its heart is so much in the right place it is difficult to get really peeved at it .
1039	one of the most haunting , viciously honest coming-of-age films in recent memory .
1040	finds a way to tell a simple story , perhaps the simplest story of all , in a way that seems compelling and even original .
1041	a moody horror/thriller elevated by deft staging and the director 's well-known narrative gamesmanship .
1042	a map of the inner rhythms of love and jealousy and sacrifice drawn with a master 's steady stroke .
1043	the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of .
1044	i do n't know precisely what to make of steven soderbergh 's full frontal , though that did n't stop me from enjoying much of it .
1045	city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it 's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes .
1046	it 's ( ricci 's ) best work yet , this girl-woman who sincerely believes she can thwart the world 's misery with blind good will .
1047	you 'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot .
1048	a very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale ... a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more .
1049	escapism in its purest form .

1051	an endlessly fascinating , landmark movie that is as bold as anything the cinema has seen in years .

1056	as a witness to several greek-american weddings -- but , happily , a victim of none -- i can testify to the comparative accuracy of ms. vardalos ' memories and insights .
1057	shadyac shoots his film like an m. night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail 's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension .

1083	pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless todd solondzian satire and callow student film .
1084	westfeldt and juergensen exude a chemistry and comfort level that 's both saucy and endearing .
1085	windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying , the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live .
1086	there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false .
1087	marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie .

1090	madonna still ca n't act a lick .
1091	little more than a frothy vanity project .

1224	leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness .
1225	a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within .

1289	sound the trumpets : for the first time since desperately seeking susan , madonna does n't suck as an actress .
1290	the film has a few cute ideas and several modest chuckles but it is n't exactly kiddie-friendly ... alas , santa is more ho-hum than ho-ho-ho and the snowman ( who never gets to play that flute ) has all the charm of a meltdown .

1309	the principals in this cast are all fine , but bishop and stevenson are standouts .
1310	unfortunately , the picture failed to capture me .
1311	if this is the resurrection of the halloween franchise , it would have been better off dead .
1312	a mixed bag of a comedy that ca n't really be described as out of this world .
1313	given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there is n't much .

1331	flat , but with a revelatory performance by michelle williams .
1332	the movie 's biggest offense is its complete and utter lack of tension .
1333	when a film is created solely because it 's a marketable product , soulless and ugly movies like this are the result .
1334	while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what 's supposed to be a comedy .

1379	instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film 's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre .
1380	steve irwin 's method is ernest hemmingway at accelerated speed and volume .
1381	far from perfect , but its heart is in the right place ... innocent and well-meaning .
1382	much of what is meant to be ` inspirational ' and ` uplifting ' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing ( the movie 's ) mindset .

1409	her film is unrelentingly claustrophobic and unpleasant .
1410	the scope of the silberstein family is large and we grow attached to their lives , full of strength , warmth and vitality . .

1412	those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida .
1413	whatever eyre 's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place .

1415	he just wants them to be part of the action , the wallpaper of his chosen reality .
1416	jolie 's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .
1417	a strong first quarter , slightly less so second quarter , and average second half .
1418	once you get into its rhythm ... the movie becomes a heady experience .
1419	but in imax 3-d , the clichés disappear into the vertiginous perspectives opened up by the photography .
1420	a sweet-natured reconsideration of one of san francisco 's most vital , if least widely recognized , creative fountainheads .
1421	a little too pat for its own good .
1422	even if britney spears is really cute , her movie is really bad .

1430	a miniscule little bleep on the film radar , but one that many more people should check out
1431	the wwii drama is well plotted , visually striking and filled with enjoyably complex characters who are never what they first appear .

1433	cho 's fans are sure to be entertained ; it 's only fair in the interest of full disclosure to say that -- on the basis of this film alone -- i 'm not one of them .

1440	remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ?
1441	an uneven film dealing with too many problems to be taken seriously .
1442	leave these flowers unpicked -- they 're dead on the vine .
1443	my oh my , is this an invigorating , electric movie .
1444	audiences conditioned to getting weepy over saucer-eyed , downy-cheeked moppets and their empathetic caretakers will probably feel emotionally cheated by the film 's tart , sugar-free wit .
1445	almost every scene in this film is a gem that could stand alone , a perfectly realized observation of mood , behavior and intent .
1446	the story may not be new , but australian director john polson , making his american feature debut , jazzes it up adroitly .
1447	k-19 may not hold a lot of water as a submarine epic , but it holds even less when it turns into an elegiacally soggy saving private ryanovich .
1448	the whole thing plays out with the drowsy heaviness of synchronized swimmer wearing a wool wetsuit .
1449	so lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun .
1450	unlike the nauseating fictions peddled by such ` have-yourself-a-happy-little-holocaust ' movies as life is beautiful and jakob the liar , the grey zone is honest enough to deny the possibility of hope in auschwitz .
1451	drags along in a dazed and enervated , drenched-in-the - past numbness .
1452	britney has been delivered to the big screen safe and sound , the way we like our 20-year-old superstar girls to travel on the fame freeway .
1453	this may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer 's coming-of-age .
1454	steers turns in a snappy screenplay that curls at the edges ; it 's so clever you want to hate it .
1455	it extends the writings of jean genet and john rechy , the films of fassbinder , perhaps even the nocturnal works of goya .
1456	julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan .
1457	extremely dumb .
1458	the production values are up there .
1459	perhaps no picture ever made has more literally showed that the road to hell is paved with good intentions .
1460	i complain all the time about seeing the same ideas repeated in films over and over again , but the bourne identity proves that a fresh take is always possible .
1461	a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek .
1462	an absorbing trip into the minds and motivations of people under stress as well as a keen , unsentimental look at variations on the theme of motherhood .
1463	it 's also the year 's sweetest movie .
1464	jagger the actor is someone you want to see again .
1465	the ill-conceived modern-day ending falls flat where it should deliver a moral punch .
1466	when the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility .
1467	ray liotta and jason patric do some of their best work in their underwritten roles , but do n't be fooled : nobody deserves any prizes here .
1468	for a shoot - 'em - up , ballistic is oddly lifeless .
1469	all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit .
1470	the film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles .
1471	a bold and subversive film that cuts across the grain of what is popular and powerful in this high-tech age , speaking its truths with spellbinding imagery and the entrancing music of philip glass .
1472	although life or something like it is very much in the mold of feel-good movies , the cast and director stephen herek 's polished direction pour delightfully piquant wine from aged bottles .
1473	( anderson ) uses a hit-or-miss aesthetic that hits often enough to keep the film entertaining even if none of it makes a lick of sense .
1474	anyone who can count to five ( the film 's target market ? )
1475	an impressive debut for first-time writer-director mark romanek , especially considering his background is in music video .
1476	sadly , hewitt 's forte is leaning forward while wearing low-cut gowns , not making snappy comebacks .
1477	this version incarnates the prophetic book in a way even its exacting author might admire .
1478	the tug-of-war at the core of beijing bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes .
1479	but in its child-centered , claustrophobic context , it can be just as frightening and disturbing -- even punishing .
1480	some of seagal 's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot .
1481	time changer may not be the most memorable cinema session but its profound self-evaluation message about our fragile existence and the absence of spiritual guidance should at least invade an abundance of mindsets
1482	a triumph of art direction over narrative , but what art direction !
1483	the movie has an avalanche of eye-popping visual effects .
1484	not everything works , but the average is higher than in mary and most other recent comedies .
1485	though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there 's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention .
1486	a sports movie with action that 's exciting on the field and a story you care about off it .
1487	the result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached .
1488	not a cozy or ingratiating work , but it 's challenging , sometimes clever , and always interesting , and those are reasons enough to see it .
1489	for me , this opera is n't a favorite , so it 's a long time before the fat lady sings .
1490	chicago is , in many ways , an admirable achievement .
1491	this is such a dazzlingly self-assured directorial debut that it 's hard to know what to praise first .
1492	excellent acting and direction .
1493	say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue .
1494	we get some truly unique character studies and a cross-section of americana that hollywood could n't possibly fictionalize and be believed .
1495	if your senses have n't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests , if you 're a connoisseur of psychological horror , this is your ticket .
1496	( a ) hollywood sheen bedevils the film from the very beginning ... ( but ) lohman 's moist , deeply emotional eyes shine through this bogus veneer ...
1497	a sensual performance from abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we 're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at .
1498	when ( de palma 's ) bad , he 's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done .
1499	as are its star , its attitude and its obliviousness .
1500	it is also , at times , curiously moving .
1501	an exciting and involving rock music doc , a smart and satisfying look inside that tumultuous world .
1502	is n't it great ?
1503	think of it as a sort of comfort food for the mind .
1504	a worthy entry into a very difficult genre .
1505	subversive , meditative , clinical and poetic , the piano teacher is a daring work of genius .
1506	flaccid drama and exasperatingly slow journey .
1507	and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy .
1508	i 'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes .
1509	a stunning piece of visual poetry that will , hopefully , be remembered as one of the most important stories to be told in australia 's film history .
1510	truth to tell , if you 've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there 's nothing here you have n't seen before .
1511	branagh , in his most forceful non-shakespeare screen performance , grounds even the softest moments in the angry revolt of his wit .
1512	all this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull .
1513	splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers ' puppet strings .
1514	an intelligent fiction about learning through cultural clash .
1515	may be spoofing an easy target -- those old ' 50 's giant creature features -- but ... it acknowledges and celebrates their cheesiness as the reason why people get a kick out of watching them today .
1516	this is the kind of movie that used to be right at home at the saturday matinee , and it still is .
1517	this series should have died long ago , but they keep bringing it back another day as punishment for paying money to see the last james bond movie .
1518	an original gem about an obsession with time .
1519	obstacles are too easily overcome and there is n't much in the way of character development in the script .
1520	suffers from rambling , repetitive dialogue and the visual drabness endemic to digital video .
1521	we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting .
1522	katz uses archival footage , horrifying documents of lynchings , still photographs and charming old reel-to-reel recordings of meeropol entertaining his children to create his song history , but most powerful of all is the song itself
1523	much monkeyfun for all .
1524	there 's suspension of disbelief and then there 's bad screenwriting ... this film packs a wallop of the latter .
1525	all the well-meaningness in the world ca n't erase the fact that the believer feels like a 12-step program for the jewish nazi .
1526	in fessenden 's horror trilogy , this theme has proved important to him and is especially so in the finale .
1527	if you 're not the target demographic ... this movie is one long chick-flick slog .
1528	this is a very fine movie -- go see it .
1529	half of it is composed of snappy patter and pseudo-sophisticated cultural observations , while the remainder ... would be more at home on a daytime television serial .
1530	filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low .
1531	like the film 's almost anthropologically detailed realization of early - '80s suburbia , it 's significant without being overstated .
1532	i loved looking at this movie .
1533	the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .
1534	as hugh grant says repeatedly throughout the movie , ` lovely !
1535	a spunky , original take on a theme that will resonate with singles of many ages .
1536	the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television - caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .
1537	this bold and lyrical first feature from raja amari expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wan na have fun into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment .
1538	fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense .
1539	it 's a hoot and a half , and a great way for the american people to see what a candidate is like when he 's not giving the same 15-cent stump speech .
1540	this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it 's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay .
1541	nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about .
1542	the problem is n't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball .
1543	it 's all pretty cynical and condescending , too .
1544	writer/director john mckay ignites some charming chemistry between kate and jed but , when he veers into sodden melodrama , punctuated by violins , it 's disastrous and kate 's jealous female friends become downright despicable .
1545	the people in dogtown and z-boys are so funny , aggressive and alive , you have to watch them because you ca n't wait to see what they do next .
1546	newton draws our attention like a magnet , and acts circles around her better known co-star , mark wahlberg .
1547	i whole-heartedly recommend that everyone see this movie -- for its historical significance alone .
1548	but like most rabbits , it seems to lack substance .
1549	birot 's directorial debut ( she co-wrote the script with christophe honoré ) is n't so much bad as it is bland .
1550	this warm and gentle romantic comedy has enough interesting characters to fill several movies , and its ample charms should win over the most hard-hearted cynics .
1551	in the end , punch-drunk love is one of those films that i wanted to like much more than i actually did .
1552	despite the premise of a good story ... it wastes all its star power on cliched or meaningless roles .
1553	boring we did n't .
1554	children may not understand everything that happens -- i 'm not sure even miyazaki himself does -- but they will almost certainly be fascinated , and undoubtedly delighted .
1555	a captivating cross-cultural comedy of manners .
1556	director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you 'll find on a french poodle .
1557	the movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .
1558	the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive .
1559	absorbing and disturbing -- perhaps more disturbing than originally intended -- but a little clarity would have gone a long way .
1560	sorry , charlie
1561	the lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt .
1562	while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling .
1563	cute , funny , heartwarming digitally animated feature film with plenty of slapstick humor for the kids , lots of in-jokes for the adults and heart enough for everyone .
1564	with a cast that includes some of the top actors working in independent film , lovely & amazing involves us because it is so incisive , so bleakly amusing about how we go about our lives .
1565	a film of precious increments artfully camouflaged as everyday activities .
1566	feel bad for king , who 's honestly trying , and schwartzman , who 's shot himself in the foot .
1567	this clever caper movie has twists worthy of david mamet and is enormous fun for thinking audiences .
1568	a dream cast of solid female talent who build a seamless ensemble .
1569	quite funny for the type of movie it is ...
1570	despite its flaws , secretary stays in your head and makes you question your own firmly held positions .
1571	before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon .
1572	münch 's genuine insight makes the film 's occasional overindulgence forgivable .
1573	this is one of the most visually stunning and thematically moving epics in recent memory , and in spite of numerous minor flaws , scorsese 's best in more than a decade .
1574	undercover brother does n't go far enough .
1575	maudlin and melodramatic we expected .
1576	everytime you think undercover brother has run out of steam , it finds a new way to surprise and amuse .
1577	lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel .
1578	this time out , ( sade ) is an unsettlingly familiar figure -- in turns loyal and deceitful , responsible and reckless , idealistically selfless and coldly self-interested .
1579	too timid to bring a sense of closure to an ugly chapter of the twentieth century .
1580	a triumph , relentless and beautiful in its downbeat darkness .
1581	the experience of watching blobby old-school cgi animation in this superlarge format is just surreal enough to be diverting .
1582	the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day .
1583	the film delivers not just the full assault of reno 's immense wit and insight , but a time travel back to what it felt like during those unforgettably uncertain days .
1584	do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor .
1585	human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal .
1586	you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they 're each interesting .
1587	what 's at stake in this film is nothing more than an obsolete , if irritating , notion of class .
1588	anchored by a terrific performance by abbass , satin rouge shows that the idea of women 's self-actualization knows few continental divides .
1589	awkward but sincere and , ultimately , it wins you over .
1590	though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .
1591	a worthy tribute to a great humanitarian and her vibrant ` co-stars . '
1592	a minor picture with a major identity crisis -- it 's sort of true and it 's sort of bogus and it 's ho-hum all the way through .
1593	just like hearst 's enormous yacht , it 's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination .
1594	lauren ambrose comes alive under the attention from two strangers in town - with honest performances and realistic interaction between the characters , this is a coming-of-age story with a twist .
1595	the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear .
1596	sucking all the ` classic ' out of robert louis stevenson 's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst ...
1597	an experience so engrossing it is like being buried in a new environment .
1598	it 's never a good sign when a film 's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma .
1599	an imaginative comedy/thriller .
1600	audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school .
1601	this version 's no classic like its predecessor , but its pleasures are still plentiful .
1602	outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time .
1603	bullock does a good job here of working against her natural likability .
1604	it 's as flat as an open can of pop left sitting in the sun .
1605	in the second half of the film , frei 's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis .
1606	s personal revelations regarding what the shop means in the big picture , iconic characters gambol fluidly through the story , with charming results .
1607	the bourne identity is what summer screen escapism used to be in the decades when it was geared more to grownups .
1608	thirty years ago , it would have been groundbreaking .
1609	run , do n't walk , to see this barbed and bracing comedy on the big screen .
1610	it 's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness .
1611	opens at a funeral , ends on the protagonist 's death bed and does n't get much livelier in the three hours in between .
1612	nolan bravely treads where few american films dare to delve -- into the world of ambivalence and ambiguity ...
1613	no more .
1614	one of the greatest family-oriented , fantasy-adventure movies ever .
1615	the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan 's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .
1616	the filmmakers juggle and juxtapose three story lines but fail to come up with one cogent point , unless it 's that life stinks , especially for sensitive married women who really love other women .
1617	it 's a minor comedy that tries to balance sweetness with coarseness , while it paints a sad picture of the singles scene .
1618	the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie .
1619	moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance .
1620	static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , hey arnold !
1621	it 's a refreshing change from the self-interest and paranoia that shape most american representations of castro .
1622	what parents will suspect is that they 're watching a 76-minute commercial .
1623	an enjoyable film for the family , amusing and cute for both adults and kids .
1624	a film made with as little wit , interest , and professionalism as artistically possible for a slummy hollywood caper flick .
1625	moore 's complex and important film is also , believe it or not , immensely entertaining , a david and goliath story that 's still very much playing itself out .
1626	she lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs .
1627	what really surprises about wisegirls is its low-key quality and genuine tenderness .
1628	too bad the former murphy brown does n't pop reese back .
1629	you can practically smell the patchouli oil .
1630	shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme .
1631	it dares to be a little different , and that shading is what makes it worthwhile .
1632	a slick , skillful little horror film .
1633	would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year .
1634	about nowhere kids who appropriated turfs as they found them and become self-made celebrity athletes -- a low-down version of the american dream .
1635	hey , who else needs a shower ?
1636	never mind whether you buy the stuff about barris being a cia hit man .
1637	expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially seven , which director william malone slavishly copies .
1638	nearly surreal , dabbling in french , this is no simple movie , and you 'll be taking a risk if you choose to see it .
1639	the fact that the rookie is a nearly impeccable cinematic experience -- and a wonderful all-ages triumph besides -- is a miracle akin to the story the film portrays .
1640	what you would end up with if you took orwell , bradbury , kafka , george lucas and the wachowski brothers and threw them into a blender .
1641	windtalkers celebrates the human spirit and packs an emotional wallop .
1642	smith profiles five extraordinary american homes , and because the owners seem fully aware of the uses and abuses of fame , it 's a pleasure to enjoy their eccentricities .
1643	proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie .
1644	imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs .
1645	guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things .
1646	despite the long running time , the pace never feels slack -- there 's no scene that screams `` bathroom break ! ''
1647	pray 's film works well and will appeal even to those who are n't too familiar with turntablism .
1648	the best movie of its kind since ` brazil . '
1649	roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut .
1650	makmalbaf follows a resolutely realistic path in this uncompromising insight into the harsh existence of the kurdish refugees of iran 's borderlands .
1651	... a roller-coaster ride of a movie
1652	the film is faithful to what one presumes are the book 's twin premises -- that we become who we are on the backs of our parents , but we have no idea who they were at our age ; and that time is a fleeting and precious commodity no matter how old you are .
1653	began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course .
1654	disney 's live-action division has a history of releasing cinematic flotsam , but this is one occasion when they have unearthed a rare gem .
1655	audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones .
1656	looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due .
1657	it 's obviously struck a responsive chord with many south koreans , and should work its magic in other parts of the world .
1658	rainy days and movies about the disintegration of families always get me down .
1659	... breathes surprising new life into the familiar by amalgamating genres and adding true human complexity to its not-so-stock characters . '
1660	it is ridiculous , of course ... but it is also refreshing , disarming , and just outright enjoyable despite its ridiculousness .
1661	for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy 's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies .
1662	it 's not so much enjoyable to watch as it is enlightening to listen to new sides of a previous reality , and to visit with some of the people who were able to make an impact in the theater world .
